# Rock and Roll: Trail to Fame

Basically Oregon Trail except you're managing a rock band; partially inspired by Harmonix Rock Band 4 campaign mode

## How to run
1. Clone repo into the desired folder
2. Open a terminal in the cloned repository
    * You'll want to use a program that supports color. For example, if you're on Windows you should use PowerShell instead of Command Prompt.
3. Run `npm i` to install all dependencies
4. Run `npm run compile && npm start`
5. Enjoy the game!
